## The stage of the codebase
The codebase is far from a production-ready application. There are lots of topics that need to be covered. From stability, clean code, unit tests and etc.

## Architecture
I've used a three-layered architecture for this application, something similar to MVVM or MVP. I tried to separate the presentation layer from logic/business and also model/state.
<br />
By keeping as less logic as possible in ui components and the wrap the logic inside composable.
<br />
The logic behind mqtt client is encapsulated inside MqttService.ts and was injected as a singleton to the application.
<br />
Also, I tried to prevent overusingÂ the global state management by keeping fewer data on it and also no logic inside.
